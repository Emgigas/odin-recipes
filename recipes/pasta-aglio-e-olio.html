    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A pasta dish made olive oil and garlic.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Spaghetti</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>tomato sauce</li>
        <li>small red chilli</li>
        <li>parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pan of well-salted water to the boil and cook the spaghetti for about 10 mins, or until al dente - it should retain a little bite.</li>
        <li>When the pasta is nearly ready, heat the oil in a frying pan set over a medium heat and sizzle the garlic and chilli, if using, for 1 minute until fragrant and the garlic is lightly golden but not brown (the garlic will taste bitter if it gets too dark).</li>
        <li>Drain the spaghetti and add it to the garlicky oil with the parsley. Season and toss to combine, then serve.</li>
